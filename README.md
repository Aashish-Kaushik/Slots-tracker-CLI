# Slots-tracker-CLI
* Using the Javascript programming language, I built the application

I built a COVID-19 vaccination slots tracker using the CLI. Using this method, you will be able to call the live API and have the slots available in your chosen district returned to you. The tracker will also provide users with additional information such as the contact information of the vaccination centres, the address, and the number of slots in stock.
